### Abstract
The rapid transmission of COVID-19 has caused a global health crisis. One of the primary ways to reduce the spread of the virus is to practice social distancing. Specifically, it is important to stay at least six feet away from others. However, it is difficult to implement this, and people can often forget to maintain this distance when they are in a public place.

My solution is a Social Distancing Sensor. This system consists of multiple devices that communicate with each other through both ultrasonic (US) signals and radio frequency (RF) signals. The devices are programmed with the use of microcontrollers so that when any two units come within six feet of each other, both units begin beeping, hence notifying both users with these devices to step away from each other.

Although not completely accurate, my prototype shows successful proof-of-concept and the devices demonstrate successful bi-directional ultrasound and radio-frequency communication.
